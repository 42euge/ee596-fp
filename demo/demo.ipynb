    "### What is GRPO?\n",
    "GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) is a critic-free reinforcement learning algorithm that:\n",
    "- Compares multiple model generations to find the best response\n",
    "- Uses relative rankings instead of absolute reward values\n",
    "- Achieves ~12% improvement on math reasoning benchmarks (GSM8K)\n",

    "- **Base Model**: Gemma3-1B-IT (instruction-tuned)\n",
    "- **Training Library**: [Google Tunix](https://github.com/google/tunix)\n",
    "- **Reward Function**: Rubric-as-Reward (RaR) + Format Compliance\n",
    "- **Fine-tuning Method**: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)"

    "   ```\n",
    "   responses = [model.generate(prompt) for _ in range(N)]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Score Responses**: Use reward functions to score each response\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   rewards = [\n",
    "       format_reward(r) +      # Check <reasoning> and <answer> tags\n",
    "       rubric_reward(r) +      # Rubric overlap scoring  \n",

    "   for r in responses]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Compute Advantages**: Use relative ranking within the group\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   advantages = (rewards - mean(rewards)) / std(rewards)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
